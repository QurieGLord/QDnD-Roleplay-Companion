## 🔄 Session 8: Journal, Polish & Localization
**Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Current Focus**: Localization & Final Polish

### Goals
- [ ] Adventurer's Journal (quests, notes)
- [x] Full Russian localization (UI + Data) ✅
- [x] Add 4 additional color themes (6 total implemented)
- [ ] FC5 export functionality
- [ ] Import/export backup (JSON)
- [ ] Final polish & bug fixes
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Deliverables
- [ ] Production-ready app
- [x] Full EN/RU support
- [x] 6 themes working
- [ ] Export to FC5
- [ ] Backup/restore

### Technical Tasks

#### 1. Journal Tab
```dart
class JournalTab extends StatelessWidget {
  - Quest log (checkboxes, markdown support)
  - Notes system (Google Keep style)
  - Session history (dates, locations)
  - Inspirational quotes (random, animated backgrounds)
}
```

#### 2. Localization
- [x] Integrate `flutter_localizations` and `intl`
- [x] Create `l10n.yaml` and ARB files
- [x] Implement `LocaleProvider` for language switching
- [x] Translate all UI strings (Settings, Sheet, Combat, Wizard)
- [x] Data migration script for JSON assets
- [x] Dynamic value localization (colors, units)

#### 3. Additional Themes
- [x] Implemented `AppPalettes` with QMonokai, Gruvbox, Catppuccin, etc.

#### 4. FC5 Export
```dart
class FC5Exporter {
  static String export(Character character) {
    // Convert Character → FC5 XML format
    return xmlString;
  }
}
```

#### 6. Polish & Logic Fixes
- [x] Spell Selection Logic: Added `SpellPreparationManager` to enforce prepared spell limits (Wizard/Cleric/etc).
- [ ] Spell Selection in Wizard: `CharacterCreationWizard` needs a step to write chosen spells.
- [ ] Multiclass UI: `LevelUpScreen` currently assumes leveling up the *primary* class.
- [ ] Content Population: Fill `assets/data/features/` for remaining classes.

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All text in both EN and RU
- ✅ All 5+ themes work perfectly
- ✅ Export "Кюри" → import to Fight Club 5 → no data loss
- ✅ Backup/restore preserves all data
- ✅ No performance issues (smooth 60 FPS)
- ✅ App size < 50 MB
- ✅ Zero critical bugs
